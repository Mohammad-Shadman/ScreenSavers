# ScreenSavers
a simple set of screen savers made in C and winAPI.

the structure of the graphical code is similar to the tutorial of Ryan Ries for how they were made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFFrBSdBvA&list=PLlaINRtydtNWuRfd4Ra3KeD6L9FP_tDE7
it is a prety usful tool for aiding in understanding the WinAPI
